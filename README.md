# AI-Chatbot-Using-Python
We first import the necessary modules from chatterbot.
We create a new ChatBot instance named 'MyChatBot'.
We create a ChatterBotCorpusTrainer instance to train the chatbot using the English corpus provided by chatterbot.
We define a function chat_with_bot() to interact with the chatbot. Inside this function, we continuously prompt the user for input and print the chatbot's response until the user types 'bye'.
We call the chat_with_bot() function to start chatting with the bot.
Before running this code, make sure you have chatterbot installed. You can install it using pip:

Copy code
# pip install chatterbot
Once you've installed chatterbot, you can run the code, and the chatbot will start interacting with you based on the pre-trained English corpus. You can also train the chatbot with custom datasets or further customize its behavior according to your requirements.
